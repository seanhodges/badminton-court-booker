# badminton-court-booker
Simple script to automatically login to a local sports centre website and book a court.

I wrote this script to automate the booking process and triggered it to book at half past midnight each week to ensure we always beat other members to a court.

This script is no longer in active use, but feel free to steal and repurpose the ASP action helper if you have a use for it!
